Useful questions to answer if you're having problems include:

* What version of AMClient are you using?

## Contribution standards

For more information on contribution guidelines and standards, see the
CONTRIBUTING.md in the [Archivematica project][contribute-to-am].

## Contributor's Agreement

In order for the Archivematica development team to accept any patches or code
commits, contributors must first sign this
[Contributor's Agreement][contributors-agreement].

The Archivematica contributor's agreement is based almost verbatim on the
[Apache Foundation][apache-org]'s individual
[contributor license][contributor-license].

If you have any questions or concerns about the Contributor's Agreement, please
email us at agreement@artefactual.com to discuss them.

### Why do I have to sign a Contributor's Agreement?

One of the key challenges for open source software is to support a
collaborative development environment while protecting the rights of
contributors and users over the long-term. Unifying Archivematica copyrights
through contributor agreements is the best way to protect the availability and
sustainability of Archivematica over the long-term as free and open-source
software. In all cases, contributors who sign the Contributor's Agreement
retain full rights to use their original contributions for any other purpose
outside of Archivematica, while enabling Artefactual Systems, or any successor
organization which may eventually take over responsibility for Archivematica,
and the wider Archivematica community, to benefit from their collaboration and
contributions in this open source project.

[Artefactual Systems][af-systems] has made the decision and has a proven track
record of making our intellectual property available to the community at large.
By standardizing contributions on these agreements the Archivematica
intellectual property position does not become too complicated. This ensures
our resources are devoted to making our project the best they can be, rather
than fighting legal battles over contributions.

### How do I send in an agreement?

Please print out, read, sign, and scan the
[contributor agreement][contributors-agreement] and email it to
agreement@artefactual.com. Alternatively, you may send an original signed
agreement to:

    Artefactual Systems Inc.
    201 - 301 Sixth Street
    New Westminster BC  V3L 3A7
    Canada
